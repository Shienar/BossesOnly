This mod turns all non-boss enemies into the next unbeaten boss that the "Boss Checklist" mod lists for progression. This mod doesn't work without the "Boss Checklist" mod.

Update 0.5:
- Added two new mod config options.
	- Toggle whether or not enemies will be turned into bosses.
	- Toggle whether or not multiple bosses can spawn at once. This gives players the power to prevent certain modded bosses from self-duplicating infinitely.

Update 0.4:
- The brain of cthulhu will now spawn in place of the eater of worlds for worlds with the crimson evil.

Update 0.3:
- Added a fix for the destroyer self-duplicating

Update 0.2:
- Fixed various bugs that allowed bosses to self-duplicate from spawned minions.
- Now spawns both twins at once, not just one.
